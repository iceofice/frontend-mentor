## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned basic html and css to complete the challenge. Even though it is not 100% correct, I think I did a great job. I learned about background, flexbox , shadow to name a few of css properties. Fot the html, I have learned it before so nothing new.

### Continued development

I am planning to learn more about css properties especially about responsiveness. Media query, em, rem, flex and many more.
